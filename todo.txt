GOTTA DO:
-facebook widget feed within about popup
-gear tab on its own page?
-store tab that redirects to zugzwangrecords.bigcartel.com

-create a redeem page that checks if the users email is in the database,
and only displays the song list if it does. the links to the tracks can
be stored in a sql db down the road, for a little more obscurity
-fonts
-spell checking, proofreading
